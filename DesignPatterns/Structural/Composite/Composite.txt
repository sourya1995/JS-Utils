- Composite pattern used to structure objects in a tree-like hierarchy
- Each node can have child nodes, or be a leaf
- leaf objects handle client requests
- if a component has children, the children handle the request
- component - abstract class with get, add , remove methods to manage the children
- composite - subclass, implements the component
- leaf - subclass, implements the composite

- scalable application with lots of objects
